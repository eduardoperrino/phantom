# Welcome to Phantom!

Phantom is a small side project used to experiment with different technologies and design patterns to resolve a challenge.

## The Challenge

During the pandemic, my community of neighbours decided to have all our meetings remote-friendly. 
Now more people joined them, but a communication issue arose because it's challenging to be aware of the 
decisions. After some discussions, we agreed to be informed in real-time but also to have a way to access 
decisions later.

## Proposed solution

The system will provide a web application where any neighbour can connect and see the decisions in real-time. 
Also, it will provide a subscription service to get them in their inbox email, allowing later access.
